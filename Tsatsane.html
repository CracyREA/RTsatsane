    <h1>My hectic saturday!</h1>
    <p>
     I woke up early yesterday morning to prepare for my classes and I was already feeling tired from Friday's afternoon class.I got to        school already feeling some type of way, and my maths teacher told us that one of my closest friends had commited suicide.I felt very      very weak after I heard the news.I didn't know what else to do and tears started running down my face.In just a blink of an eye my        world stopped, it was quiet and everything was black.The next I knew I was at home there with my mom ready to comfort me.It really        turned out to be one of the worst days everrrr!.
